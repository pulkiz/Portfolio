      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Pulkit Grover, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at York University. I was born and raised in Pune, India, and moved to Toronto in 2023 to further my academic and personal growth. Transitioning to life in Canada has been both exciting and challenging, but it has fueled my independence and broadened my perspective on what it means to succeed in a global, tech-driven world.<br>
        My passion for technology began early—around the age of ten—when my grandfather introduced me to the world of electronics and computing. I was instantly hooked. I loved breaking apart devices to see how they worked, and the intricate hardware inside always fascinated me. As I got older, I started experimenting with computer operating systems and software, often modifying them just to see what was possible. <br>
        I eventually moved on to modding Android and iOS devices—rooting, jailbreaking, and installing custom operating systems, then rigorously testing them. These hands-on experiences gave me a deep appreciation for the complexity of both hardware and software, and they laid the foundation for my journey into programming.<br>
        As I advanced, I taught myself how to code and quickly saw how powerful it could be when paired with my curiosity and hardware knowledge. Now, I'm particularly passionate about computer hardware, systems development, and emerging fields like artificial intelligence, which I am eager to explore in depth.<br>
        Beyond academics, I believe in a well-rounded lifestyle. I go to the gym regularly and independently study nutrition to better understand how to support both physical and mental performance. Cooking and baking have become creative hobbies that bring me balance, while playing soccer helps me stay active and reinforces the importance of teamwork.<br>
        Choosing York University, and specifically the Lassonde School of Engineering, was a thoughtful decision. Its focus on innovation, hands-on learning, and interdisciplinary thinking perfectly aligns with my interests and goals in tech.<br>
        As I continue to grow in this field, I hope to contribute meaningfully to the world of technology—whether through building efficient systems, developing impactful software, or exploring the frontiers of AI.</p>
